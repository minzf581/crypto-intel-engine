# Railway Deployment Guide for Crypto Intelligence Engine

## 🚀 Deployment Status: READY ✅

Your Crypto Intelligence Engine is now fully prepared for Railway deployment!

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

All items below have been completed and verified:

- ✅ **Essential Files**: All required files are present
- ✅ **Build Scripts**: Server and client build processes configured
- ✅ **Railway Config**: Health checks and environment variables set
- ✅ **Nixpacks Config**: Build commands and Node.js environment configured
- ✅ **Health Endpoint**: `/health` route with proper response
- ✅ **Dependencies**: All packages installed and compatible

## 🔧 Configuration Summary

### Railway Configuration (`railway.toml`)
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"
buildCommand = "npm run build"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm start"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3

[env]
NODE_ENV = "production"
NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION = "false"
CORS_ORIGIN = "${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}"
PORT = "${{PORT}}"
```

### Nixpacks Configuration (`nixpacks.toml`)
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_20", "python3"]

[phases.install]
cmds = [
  "npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit",
  "cd server && npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit",
  "cd client && npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit"
]

[phases.build]
buildCmd = "npm run build"
cmds = [
  "npm run build:server",
  "npm run build:client",
  "npm run verify:build"
]

[start]
cmd = "npm start"
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Push to Git Repository**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: prepare for Railway deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Railway Auto-Deploy**: Railway will automatically detect changes and deploy

3. **Monitor Deployment**: Check Railway dashboard for deployment progress

### Option 2: Manual Railway CLI Deployment
1. **Install Railway CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login to Railway**:
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

## 🏥 Health Check Verification

Once deployed, verify the health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-XX...",
  "uptime": "XX seconds",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## 🌍 Environment Variables

Railway will automatically set:
- `PORT`: Application port (Railway managed)
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production"
- `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`: Your app's public domain

Optional variables you can set in Railway dashboard:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (if using external DB)
- `COINGECKO_API_KEY`: For enhanced API limits
- `JWT_SECRET`: For user authentication

## 📊 Expected Build Output

During deployment, you should see:
```
📦 Installing dependencies...
🔨 Building server... ✅ Server compiled (XX.XKB)
🔨 Building client... ✅ Client built (XX.XKB)
✅ Build verification passed
🚀 Starting application...
✅ Health check passed
🌐 Application deployed successfully
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Build Timeout**:
   - Increase `healthcheckTimeout` in `railway.toml`
   - Check for large dependencies

2. **Health Check Fails**:
   - Verify `/health` endpoint is accessible
   - Check server startup logs

3. **Port Issues**:
   - Ensure server uses `process.env.PORT`
   - Verify Railway PORT variable is set

4. **Database Connection**:
   - Check `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
   - Verify database service is running

### Debug Commands

Run locally to test:
```bash
# Test build process
npm run build

# Test server startup
npm start

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Quick status check
node quick-status-check.js
```

## 📈 Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. **Test All Endpoints**: Verify API functionality
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check Railway metrics
3. **Set Up Monitoring**: Configure alerts for downtime
4. **Update DNS**: Point custom domain if needed

## 🎉 Success!

Your Crypto Intelligence Engine is now live on Railway! 

- **Frontend**: Accessible via Railway public domain
- **Backend API**: Available at `/api/*` endpoints
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates enabled
- **Health Monitoring**: Automatic health checks active

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Verify all environment variables
3. Test health endpoint
4. Review this guide for troubleshooting steps
