## Coding Standards

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow React best practices for state management
- Use proper component composition
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization when needed

### State Management
- Use React Context for global state
- Use useState and useEffect for local state
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Use custom hooks for complex logic

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Follow responsive design principles
- Implement dark mode support
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Follow accessibility guidelines

### API Design
- Use RESTful API conventions
- Implement proper HTTP status codes
- Use consistent response formats
- Include proper error handling
- Implement rate limiting where appropriate

### Database
- Use Sequelize ORM for database operations
- Follow proper database naming conventions
- Implement proper indexes for performance
- Use transactions for data integrity
- Follow database migration best practices

## Security Guidelines
- Implement JWT authentication
- Use proper input validation and sanitization
- Implement CORS properly
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Follow security best practices for WebSocket connections

## Performance Guidelines
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use lazy loading for components
- Optimize database queries
- Implement proper pagination
- Use WebSocket connections efficiently

## Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Write component tests for React components
- Use meaningful test descriptions in English
- Maintain good test coverage

## Error Handling
- Use consistent error response formats
- Implement proper error logging
- Provide meaningful error messages in English
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Implement proper fallback UI states

## Real-time Features
- Use Socket.IO for real-time updates
- Implement proper connection handling
- Handle disconnections gracefully
- Use event-driven architecture
- Implement proper authentication for WebSocket connections

## Cryptocurrency Integration
- Use CoinGecko API for price data
- Implement proper rate limiting for external APIs
- Handle API failures gracefully
- Cache data appropriately
- Support multiple cryptocurrency exchanges

## File Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for React components: `PriceCard.tsx`
- Use camelCase for utility functions: `formatPrice.ts`
- Use kebab-case for CSS classes: `price-card-container`
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants: `API_ENDPOINTS`

## Git Commit Guidelines
- Use conventional commits format
- Write commit messages in English
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Keep commit messages concise but descriptive

## Import/Export Guidelines
- Use named exports for utilities and hooks
- Use default exports for React components
- Group imports: external libraries, internal modules, relative imports
- Use absolute imports with path aliases

## Environment Variables
- Use clear, descriptive names in English
- Document all environment variables
- Use appropriate defaults for development
- Keep sensitive data in environment variables only

## Documentation Requirements
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Document all API endpoints
- Include setup and deployment instructions
- Document all environment variables
- Use English for all documentation

## Code Review Guidelines
- Check for English-only content
- Verify proper TypeScript usage
- Ensure proper error handling
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Verify responsive design implementation
- Ensure accessibility compliance

Remember: ANY Chinese text found in code, UI, logs, or documentation should be immediately converted to English.

## ABSOLUTE NO MOCK/DEMO/FAKE DATA POLICY
**CRITICAL: NEVER create, use, or display mock/demo/fake data in this application**

### Why Mock Data is STRICTLY PROHIBITED
- **LEGAL LIABILITY**: Mock data can mislead users into making financial decisions based on false information, potentially resulting in lawsuits
- **REGULATORY COMPLIANCE**: Financial applications must use real data to comply with regulations
- **USER TRUST**: Any fake data undermines the credibility and trustworthiness of the platform
- **MARKET INTEGRITY**: Displaying false market data can be considered market manipulation
- **PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS**: Real financial intelligence platforms never use mock data

### ZERO TOLERANCE ENFORCEMENT
- **Real-Time Tweets**: MUST use actual Twitter API data or show "Data not available" message
- **Price Data**: MUST use real CoinGecko/exchange APIs or show error states
- **Social Sentiment**: MUST use real social media analysis or display service unavailable
- **News Data**: MUST use legitimate news sources or show no data available
- **User Accounts**: MUST be production-ready authentication, no demo accounts in production
- **Trading Signals**: MUST be based on real market analysis, never simulated

### MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
- When APIs are not available: Show clear error messages explaining the service is temporarily unavailable
- When data sources are not configured: Display "Data source not configured" with admin instructions
- When external services fail: Provide transparent error states with retry options
- NEVER substitute with placeholder, demo, or mock data under any circumstances

### VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES
- Any code containing mock data will be immediately rejected
- Functions generating fake data must be removed or replaced with real API calls
- Components displaying mock data must show error states instead
- Pull requests with mock data will not be merged

### APPROVED ALTERNATIVES TO MOCK DATA
- Loading states with spinners/skeletons
- Error states with clear explanations
- "Service unavailable" messages
- "API not configured" notifications
- Empty states with instructions to configure data sources
- Graceful degradation that informs users of limited functionality

### REAL-TIME TWEETS SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
- MUST connect to actual Twitter API for tweet data
- MUST use real sentiment analysis services
- MUST display actual engagement metrics from Twitter
- MUST show real timestamps from Twitter
- If Twitter API is unavailable: Show "Twitter API not available" message
- If sentiment analysis fails: Show "Sentiment analysis unavailable"
- NEVER generate fake tweets, fake sentiment scores, or fake engagement data

### CODE REVIEW CHECKLIST
- [ ] No functions named `generateMock*`, `createFake*`, or `simulateData*`
- [ ] No hardcoded sample data arrays
- [ ] No placeholder text that looks like real data
- [ ] All API calls connect to real external services
- [ ] Error handling shows appropriate "service unavailable" messages
- [ ] No demo user accounts with fake data
- [ ] All timestamps come from real data sources
- [ ] All metrics are calculated from actual data

**REMEMBER: This is a financial intelligence platform. Users' financial decisions depend on our data accuracy. Mock data is not just unprofessional—it's potentially illegal and definitely unethical.**
